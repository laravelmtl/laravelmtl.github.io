# Laravel Montreal Slides

These are the slides I used for my "Laravel" presentations.

The slideshow framework is **reveal.js**: a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) or [fork it](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
